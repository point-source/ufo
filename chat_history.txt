Make a parametric calculator that will allow me to calculate the correct sizes of cardboard to cut to create the UFO from this blog post: https://manningkrull.com/manningmakesstuff/48-flying-saucer-halloween-decoration/

It should allow me to adjust the total diameter and height of the UFO and adjust the cutouts appropriately. It should show a preview visual of top-down, side, and iso. It should also display the unique shapes to be cut and the number of each shape needed.

Ask any necessary clarifying questions before proceeding

Great — I can build an interactive parametric calculator / generator (HTML + JavaScript) that:
	•	Lets you set total UFO diameter and total height.
	•	Lets you adjust panel counts (top small disk segments and large main disk segments) or use the blog defaults (16 for the small top, 32 for the larger rings).
	•	Calculates each unique flat panel shape (with cut dimensions), how many of each, and produces SVG previews for top-down, side, and isometric views.
	•	Optionally adds window cutouts, glue tabs, and exports downloadable SVGs (one per unique shape) ready for printing or cutting.

Before I start building it, a few clarifying questions so I get the behavior and output exactly how you want:
	1.	Units — do you prefer inches (default on the blog) or millimeters / centimeters?
	2.	Material & thickness — is the target cardboard / foam board? what thickness (e.g., 3 mm, 1/8” foam board, corrugated cardboard)? (I’ll use this for realistic panel height and bend allowance and tab sizes.)
	3.	Panel counts — do you want the generator to default to the blog’s values (top = 16 panels, middle/bottom = 32 panels) or do you want those adjustable per-ring in the UI?
	4.	Ring structure — the blog describes three flat disks (small top, large top, bottom) with vertical panels forming the walls. Do you want all three rings generated separately (small dome ring, large upper ring, lower ring) with independent diameters/heights, or a simpler 2-ring approach (inner small top + outer main top+bottom combined)?
	5.	Seams & join features — should the generated panel shapes include:
	•	glue tabs (width you specify),
	•	kerf allowance (cutting offset),
	•	overlap allowance (for taping)?
	6.	Windows / lights — do you want the generator to place window cutouts around the inner wall automatically (blog used 1″ holes spaced for ~4″ light spacing and a 1.75″ wall height)? If yes, what window diameter and spacing should be used (or default to 1” holes and 3.75” spacing as the post mentions)?
	7.	Output formats — do you want:
	•	downloadable SVG files for each unique panel shape,
	•	a single combined SVG layout with repeated panels arranged for cutting on standard sheet sizes (e.g., 24×36”, A0, or a custom sheet size),
	•	or a simple on-screen printable preview only?
	8.	Preview style — for the on-screen preview, do you prefer SVG 2D views (top, side, top-with-cut-lines) or a simple 3D-like isometric projection (vector approximation), or both? (I can do both using SVG.)
	9.	Accuracy vs convenience — do you want the tool to:
	•	strictly compute exact flat-developments of the curved surfaces (mathematically accurate trapezoids for a faceted approximation), OR
	•	use the simpler approach the blog author used (make one template panel and copy/trace it) with parameters and small manual tweak allowance?
	10.	Extra features — any of these desired? automatic sheet nesting (optimize number of sheets), labels printed on each piece (id and orientation), center hole for hanging, or cut-order marks.

If you’re happy with defaults I suggest I use:
	•	units: inches,
	•	material: foam board / poster board (approx 1/8” thick),
	•	panel counts: top=16, outer=32,
	•	wall height for inner light ring: 1.75” with 1” window holes spaced 3.75”,
	•	include glue tabs of 0.5” by default,
	•	provide SVG exports and on-screen top/side/iso SVG previews.

Tell me which options you want (or say “use your suggested defaults”) and any other preferences — then I’ll build the interactive generator and give you the HTML/SVG package you can run locally.

1. Units should be metric mm/cm
2. Thickness appears to be 5mm or almost 1/4in (foam board)
3. Make panel counts adjustable
4. 2-ring approach is good. main top + bottom can be same, inner small top separately adjustable
5. These will be taped/glued together by hand so go with best method for that
6. default to 1in holes, adjust spacing/quantity if necessary due to changes in total circumference (I plan to make a smaller version than the blog)
7. on-screen is fine. this is being measured and made by hand, not printed or cnc
8. both views, please
9. should be whatever is most likely to result in an easy-to-assemble, good looking final product when cut and fit by hand
10. none are necessary

@calc.html

Done — I created a single-file parametric generator in the canvas titled Ufo Cardboard Cutter - Parametric Generator. Open that document to use the interactive metric (mm) tool (5 mm foam board, adjustable panel counts, small-top + main-ring 2-ring approach, auto hole-fitting, SVG export of flat shapes).

Try the defaults, tweak any controls (diameter, heights, counts, hole size/spacing) and click Update preview. If you want any changes to calculations, glue-tab style, or an automatic sheet layout for cutting, tell me which details to adjust and I’ll update it.
